#Proxybot

A bot that can be used by you to consume content from the Telegram. This bot can join channels and groups instead of you and then forward messages from there to you. This way you can consume needed information from the specific channels in the aggregated form without even subscribing to those channels.

### Why it is not a plain telegram bot?
Because telegram bots can be invited to the groups and channels only by the channel admins. This bot requires a new phone number but can act as a real user and join any channels you like.

### Why do you need it?
1. Avoid having many places with the same type of content and have one
2. Tag the content
3. Limit the certain types of content (TBD)
4. Receive only messages with “trigger” words (TBD)
5. Receive messages from strangers only through the proxy (TBD)
6. Have a statistics (TBD)
7. Rate channels for you (TBD, telegram API doesn't allow using reactions yet)
